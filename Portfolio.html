                Formula SAE is an annual competition put on by SAE international for students.

                    The V66 VCU was the controller that powered the Viking 66 FSAE car.
                    The processor was a little underpowered, so required a very optimized control algorithm to get it working anywhere near real time.

                        The VCU takes in sensor data from the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal in order to figure out how much torque the motor should put out.
                        Because of the low power and lack of FPU in the chip, only a couple dozen floating point operations are used.

                        Over about an afternoon, I also wrote a tool that communicated over the can bus and allowed for real time tuning of the vehicle without completely taking the vcu out of the car and reprogramming it.
                        This was done by using the CAN bus and a custom flash memory setup.

                        After half a dozen iterations, it was clear that the scope had balooned too much to continue to be an FSAE project, and it was shelved for the V66 year car.
                        I continued to work on it to validate that my design worked.

                    After reevaluating our team's goals, and realizing that without me on the team it would be kind of impossible to maintain; 
                    we switched back to a microcontroller design, but implementing the stm32h5 to give ourselves more performance overhead.

                        While it worked well v66 year to have one person write all of the code and drivers from scratch, this model is probably unsustainable (at some point I will graduate). 
                        Therefore, one of our goals for v67 was having a certain percentage of code written by new members. 
                        To help accomplish this goal, we split up the codebase into modules that could be assigned to new members, and changed our process.

                        Another goal for v67's VCU was proper validation. v66's codebase was messy and was in a constant state of revision, with other members of the team not knowing or understanding it's behavior.
                        It also had strange edge cases and quirks that weren't obvious to anyone who weren't familiar with the codebase.

                    Therefore, while I was mentoring new members on how to write code, I also came up with a method for both communicating and verifying all behavior to other members of the electronics team, a big excel spreadsheet.
                    This came with the added benifit of being a resource that new members could look at to understand all of the necessary behavior that the VCU should do.

                    In order to optimize the design of the FSAE car, we as a team need to be able to simulate the way that the car works on track.
                    To do this, we are writing a discrete model of the car in order to understand it better.
                    <br><br>
                    This descrete mathematical model of the car can then be simulated to figure out how well it performs around a track, using a lagrange cost optimization function.
                    This is still a work in progress as we continue to validate it with viking 66, hopefully to the point where it becomes useful for 67.

                    Our FSAE team has for the last few years designed our own battery management system for the car.

                    For some reason, after coming home from competition and sitting in a closet somewhere, the segments started killing stacks.
                    We needed a new solution for the segments to prevent this from happening again, which I was an integral part of.

                        We weren't entirely sure what the issue was, so we erred on the side of caution for the whole battery.
                        I rerouted the BMS segment board with much wider tolerances between traces and some added components that we as a team figured could help solve an issue with the BMS chips we were using.

                    We also weren't left with the working codebase for the BMS segments or the BMS topbox, which meant they had to be rewritten.
                    I worked on rewriting the segment code and rewrote a bunch of drivers for the top box, and helped newer formula members to write some of the rest of the code.
                    <br><br>

                    We finally got our first segments reporting things onto the CAN bus after about 2 weeks of work, and are now working on getting the rest of the battery in working order.

                    There are many competing standards for dataloggers, and they all have their own unique files that they spit out upon logging data. 
                    At autosport labs we also have a proprietary data file format, so I wrote a conversion that would take in AIM, Motec, and VBOX files and generate a racecapture file off of them.

                    I don't own a car, but often find myself shopping for both me and my roommate with enough grocerys it becomes impractical and sometimes painful for me to carry them from the store.
                    Therefore, I wanted to get an E-bike. I already had a bike, so thought making an ebike drive system would be a fun challenge.
                    <br><br>
                    The part I was most excited about making was the motor controller, which is also known as an inverter.
                    This component is the most complicated part of the electric drive system, and it is responsible for turning the direct current from the battery pack into alternating current for the motor.

                        For some reason one of my goals for the project was to achieve a power density that was near the leading edge of inverter design.
                        Instead of normal MOSFETs that you might find in most traction inverters of it's size, it uses GAN HEMTs, which are only just starting to get commercial adoption in the last few years.
                        The main benifit of GAN HEMTs is that they can switch at very high frequencies, lowering the capacitance requirement for the inverter, allowing for slim packaging.
                        They also allow the efficiency to theoretically get to about 98.6%, much higher than a typical inverter of it's size, and allowing for a lower cooling requirement.

                        To help with both cooling and with power transmission, solid copper busbars were soldered to the underside of the PCB.
                        These will connect to the housing of the inverter with a high performance thermal pad.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to maintain the extremely high switching speed, a very fast stm32h7 will control the inverter.
                        I have already written the main control algorithm in assembly to make it as fast as possible.
