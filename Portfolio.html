                Formula SAE is an annual competition put on by SAE international for students. 
                The goal is to build a formula style car that performs well in various events, measuring both the car's performance and design.

                I joined WWU's Formula SAE team in 2023, for the V66 year car, and worked as a general low-voltage member.

                    The V66 VCU was the controller that powered the Viking 66 FSAE car.
                    The processor was a little underpowered, so required a very optimized control algorithm to get it working anywhere near real time.

                        The VCU takes in sensor data from the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal in order to figure out how much torque the motor should put out.
                        Because of the low power and lack of FPU in the chip, only a couple dozen floating point operations are used.

                        Over about an afternoon, I also wrote a tool that communicated over the can bus and allowed for real time tuning of the vehicle without completely taking the vcu out of the car and reprogramming it.
                        This was done by using the CAN bus and a custom flash memory setup.

                        the plan was to design a module that would sit on the can bus and display state to the driver and communicate with the vcu.

                        After half a dozen iterations, it was clear that the scope had balooned too much to continue to be an FSAE project, and it was shelved for the V66 year car.
                        I continued to work on it to validate that my design worked.
                        <br><br>
                        In the 6th iteration, the chunky dot matrix module was swapped for a proper screen, and the teensy was swapped for an STM U5

                    In order to optimize the design of the FSAE car, we as a team need to be able to simulate the way that the car works on track.

                    This descrete mathematical model of the car can then be simulated to figure out how well it performs around a track, using a lagrange cost optimization function.

                <div class="full-paragraph">
                    Our FSAE team has for the last few years designed our own battery management system for the car.
                    It had two parts, the segment boards that actually sat on top of the batteries, and the main board, which communicated with all of those segments.
                    For some reason, after coming home from competition and sitting in a closet somewhere, the segments started killing stacks.
                    We needed a new solution for the segments to prevent this from happening again, which I was an integral part of.

                        We weren't entirely sure what the issue was, so we erred on the side of caution for the whole battery.
                        I rerouted the BMS segment board with much wider tolerances between traces and some added components that we as a team figured could help solve an issue with the BMS chips we were using.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="full-paragraph">
                    We also weren't left with the working codebase for the BMS segments or the BMS topbox, which meant they had to be rewritten.
                    I worked on rewriting the segment code and rewrote a bunch of drivers for the top box, and helped newer formula members to write some of the rest of the code.
                    <br><br>

                    We finally got our first segments reporting things onto the CAN bus after about 2 weeks of work, and are now working on getting the rest of the battery in working order.

                    There are many competing standards for dataloggers, and they all have their own unique files that they spit out upon logging data. 
                    At autosport labs we also have a proprietary data file format, so I wrote a conversion that would take in AIM, Motec, and VBOX files and generate a racecapture file off of them.
                    <br><br>
                    While doing this I also wrote an algorithm for matching datasets to different track configurations by projecting both onto a flat plane and using mean distance.

                    Over the pandemic, I became pretty obssessed with making my own game engines using opengl and c++/c. 
                    These games and tools were usually small to moderate in scope and took me a couple months each.

                        I wrote a program that rendered fractals. 
                        It runs on the GPU so very complicated fractals can be run completely and explored in real time.

                        Origionally just a computer background, this application turned into an arcadey driving game, where the goal was to not crash.

                        It did look pretty cool and I wrote an entire engine around it with ~12,000 lines of code that I could reuse in other projects.

                        Chordle is an web game based off of the game "wordle". 
                        It was made to help musicians with ear training.

                        <br><br>

                        It was written, much like this website was, in html and javascript with no frameworks or anything else.
                        I am not a web developer and am not very good at it but I did have an idea for this website and just wanted to get it done without anything crazy.

                        <br><br>

                        It ended up being pretty difficult to make but rewarding in the end.
